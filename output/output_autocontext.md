The interface includes a graph of the waveform, numerical readings for various health parameters, and control elements for navigating the data. There are sections that display detailed readings such as SYS, DIA, Pulse, PRV, MAP, tRise, tPeak, and tFall, each accompanied by numerical values and their respective units (mmHg, bpm, %). A smaller graph at the bottom shows a related waveform, possibly an aggregated view or another health metric. The elements are visually connected through their arrangement, indicating a cohesive system for monitoring and presenting health data.
2. **Visual Elements**: The interface uses a color palette of blues and grays for the background and interactive elements. The waveform is shown as a blue line against a white background, with numerical readings displayed in white text on blue buttons. The interface also has a play button and other control elements.
3. **Layout**: The layout is structured with health parameters on the left, the primary waveform graph in the center, and additional information/controls at the bottom. Numerical readouts are neatly aligned to provide a clear and concise overview of the patient's status.
4. **Context**: The image appears to be an example reading from an intelligent cloud computed health monitoring system, showcasing the real-time data and analytical capabilities of the system. It is part of a pitch deck for JADE Healthcare Group Inc.
5. **Graph Analysis**:
   - The waveform is likely a blood pressure reading over time.
   - The y-axis is labeled "mmHg" with a scale ranging from 0 to 350.
   - The x-axis represents time, and the waveform shows cyclical peaks and troughs indicative of a normal heartbeat.
   - The graph visually represents the patient's systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

# Behind The Scenes
Reading and Reporting Flow

[Image of a reading and reporting flow diagram]
1. **Image Description**: The image depicts a flow diagram showing how data is read and reported in the JADE system. The process starts from a JADE device and progresses through various stages of data processing and storage.
   - The flow begins with the device connected via Bluetooth to a computer or mobile device.
   - Data is then transferred through a secure TCP/IP connection to "Math 1".
   - Next, the data is stored in "Storage".
   - Finally, the data reaches "DB" (Database) and then "Math 2" before reaching the "Reports".
   - Rectangular boxes with rounded corners represent functions and data, and arrows indicate the direction of data flow. There is also a cloud labelled "Internet".
   - A series of rounded boxes list a number of different types of data that can be read.
   - A line-graph is visible after the bluetooth stage, and again at the "Reading Results/Reading Alerts" stage.
2. **Visual Elements**: The diagram uses various colors for different elements, with a green logo in the upper right corner. Arrows are used to show the direction of data flow, and text labels identify each component.
3. **Layout**: The diagram is arranged from left to right, showing the flow of data. Components are placed logically to illustrate the steps involved in reading and reporting.
4. **Context**: This diagram provides an overview of the data processing pipeline within the JADE system. It is related to the concept of "Reading and Reporting Flow."

Investment Opportunity
Features, Advantages, Benefits

*   100% proprietary implementation (no third party dependencies)

*   Cloud computation and full waveform storage allows for complex algorithms to be used and updated independent of hardware

*   Designed to be fully compliant with international standards for automatic blood pressure monitors (including hardware): ESH-IP:2010, AAMI/ANSI/ISO DIN/EN 81060:2013 and SP10:2002

*   The JADE UI is a Unicode shell that supports the addition of plugins which can be downloaded or pushed from our database. Plugins allow for a highly tailored and brand enabled experience with respect to different classes and locals of users.

*   Due to the nature of the JADE system, it is very easy to implement interoperability algorithms which can push data to any existing online EHR/PHR/EMR system.

*   The JADE database has been designed from the ground up so that all entries must include values for the identification of "Manager", "Owner" and "User" (TriLink™™)


# Investment Opportunity
Features, Advantages, Benefits

*   Modular wrap around electronics and pneumatics making it slimmer, easier to use and far more portable; encouraging more comprehensive monitoring throughout the day

*   Higher fidelity and full waveform cloud computation allowing for the realization of medically significant results other than blood pressure

*   The ability to measure arm angle and 360 degree full occlusion operation, overcomes the shortcomings associated with existing wrist monitors that depend on the user to use them correctly in order to get accurate results

*   Flexible platform design allowing for the creation of custom 3rd party applications and new IOT revenue scenarios

*   Universal forward and backward compatible HDBP™ data set enables new results development, scientific research and improvements in existing algorithms without the need for new hardware

# Founders
A Core Of Highly Experienced Professionals

*   Dan Paul (Co-Founder / CEO)

    Over 25 years of experience in project management, quality assurance, team management and
    manufacturing process control. Dan is a team minded engineer who is at home in the fast paced
    multi tasking environment of quality excellence
*   John Babaris (Co-Founder / сто)

    Over 20 years of applied experience in hardware design, programming, signal processing, bio
    signal analysis, telemedicine, standards approvals, manufacturing, research studies and trials.
    John has taken medical hardware and software products from research through full development
    and production life cycles

After leaving their former healthcare technology roles, John and Dan challenged themselves and set out on a "Proof of
Concept" test project during the latter half of 2011 - could they extract the Radial Arterial Pulse from all of the "noise"
inherent with this wrist-based blood pressure waveform at an unprecedented 24-bit resolution/precision level? After
spending nearly 6 months in the lab together, their objective was finally achieved at the end of 2011. In January 2012,
JADE Healthcare was incorporated in Toronto, ON Canada. Since then the founders have developed five generations
of hardware and many generations of software and supporting Quality Assurance controls to bring their vision to life.
