Overall Structure and Themes:
- The document, a consultation document from "Tavolo per la Finanza Sostenibile," focuses on sustainability dialogue between SMEs and banks. It covers sustainability information from SMEs to banks and provides a methodological guide. Key themes include environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors.
- Recurring elements: Headings, subheadings, bullet points, numbered lists, and tables.

Formatting and Structural Observations:
- The document contains tables for data input, including units of measure and priority levels for micro-enterprises.
- Some tables are split across pages (noted below).

Interrupted Content:
- Between page 7 and page 8: The heading "Obiettivi e modalit√† della consultazione" occurs at the top of page 8, suggesting that this section may have started on the previous page without a clear ending point.
- Between page 12 and page 13: a table is split. Headers are on page 12, and the data starts on page 13.
- Between page 20 and page 21: The ending of section 5 and the title of "Guida metodologica"
- Between page 26 and page 27: a box is interrupted

Custom Context and Transcription Suggestions:

1. General:
   - Pay attention to the table structures, ensuring that columns align correctly during transcription.
   - Verify the correct interpretation of abbreviations listed on page 4.
   - Be mindful of footnotes, which provide context and regulatory references.

2. Tables:
   - Ensure numerical data and units of measure are accurately transcribed.
   - For split tables, consolidate headers and data appropriately.

3. Specific Elements:
   - When transcribing the descriptions in tables, maintain the original phrasing and formatting as closely as possible.
   - Note: "Tabella" translates to "Table" in English.

4. Discontinuities:
   - When transcribing, add a note, e.g., "(Continuation from previous page)" where content is interrupted.

5. Consultations:
   - The document explicitly states that the consultation period ends on August 2, 2024.

6. Standardization:
   - Transcription should preserve the modular approach and section divisions (Informazioni generali, mitigazione, etc.)
